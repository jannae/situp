#Sit Up. 
##Application and Project Justification
**by Jannae Jacks, Fall:2014 ITP**

### General Project Overview

Maintaining and becoming conscientious of our own state of good posture plays a very important role in our health and wellbeing. Many of us sit in front of a computer for grossly extended periods of time and, while we may have good intentions around keeping our bodies moving, these intentions tend to slip away as we are distracted.

I am proposing the creation of an OSX desktop app that requires no cost or additional hardware and monitors your posture and presence in front of the computer to keep you mindful of slouching, and also keeping you aware of how long you have been sitting in front of your computer screen.

### Project Goals

Poor posture habits are directly linked to weight gain, cardiovascular problems, shallow breathing, muscular discomfort, back and neck pain, and also believed to be linked to depression problems, body image (both your own and the way you may be viewed by others), digestive problems, and immune deficiency. Putting yourself at risk for poor physical and mental health is most certainly a thief of well being, and can lead to increased stress and significant health problems if not given proper attention. The idea that this risk is entirely preventable, and potentially involves a completely cost-free solution seems only obvious to justify the pursuit of a possible solution.

### Proposed “Solution”

Because such a large amount of many people's time is spent sitting at a desk or on a laptop, I found it appealing to research the tools available to use through the means we have currently to come up with a possible answer. I was not entirely interested in adding another device to keep up with into the mix in most of our already device-saturated lives. Devices tend to compound barrier-to-use problems, and often introduce unrelated complications to the problem. A desktop application, using the camera already built-in to the computer, seems the least amount of tools necessary to address this problem successfully from a technological perspective.

### User Experience Walkthrough

The application will start up when the computer starts, and sit in a "quiet" state in the taskbar until the user calibrates the camera tracker. The application will then guide the user into a state of achieving ideal posture by giving visual cues, and feedback to help them choose when they feel they have achieved the position described and visualized by the app's calibration wizard.

Once calibrated, the application will again lie quiet in the background until the user begins to slip from their desired "good posture" position. A small icon color change will visually indicate, and the user will be given a (configurable) amount of time to correct their position before the app bothers them insistently concerning their posture. This "bothering" can also be configured to be "quiet" or "loud" depending on the user's personal level of motivation to maintain their posture.

The application will also possess the ability to simply be "paused," for the convenience of moving around, taking a walk, performing an alternate task that requires momentary bad posture, etc.

During both the "all good" state, and the "paused" state, statistics will be available to the user concerning their "personal best" for maintaining good posture, how long they have been tracking total for all time, and how long they have been sitting at the computer presently.
I have been considering a simple enhancement which would also cause the app to encourage breaks, since it will be keenly aware of exactly how long you have actually been sitting at your computer, as opposed to other apps of this type which rely solely on the clock, and have no inherent knowledge of the user's own behavior.

### Achieving Mindfulness Through Posture

Creating a state of awareness concerning the regular attention to our own posture is, in and of itself, achieving a state of mindfulness. Posture is widely noted as a very important component of meditation, and the conscious effort of opening up the body and accommodating the breath and the blood flowing will bring you into a state of peace naturally. The mind tends also to imitate the body. Holding yourself upright, open, strong, and grounded will lead the mind into this state of being as well. For it to become second nature through the building of the habit via a positive reinforcement training mechanism is really key.

### Potential Barriers

As with any computer program, one certainly needs to be at a computer to benefit from this application. There also exists the challenge that almost any posture reinforcing tool will need to be calibrated and regularly re-evaluated due to movement, which is obviously very good and encouraged, but also creates an unavoidable barrier of necessitating regular re-calibration to maintain optimum tracking.

Most ironically, the largest barrier is indeed someone not being at their computer, or at least not being on their computer too much, which is one of the goals of the application.

### Evaluating the Competition

I kickstarted the Lumo Lift posture monitoring device a while back, and conveniently received it while I was working on this project. I don’t want to be too hard on the device, especially considering it just hit the market mere weeks ago, but so far, I have not had the most praiseworthy experience with it. 

Most importantly, I think, the charge goes out on this very quickly, quicker than I was expecting. Which means I have to remember to do that. Also, the type of top you choose to wear plays a huge role in the device’s calibration and tracking abilities. Sometimes I like flowy blouses, as opposed to fitted shirts, and sometimes I enjoy strapless tanks. If I chose to rely on this device all the time, my wardrobe would need reevaluating. 

The statistics of your “success” are measured in hours, rather than minutes, making it almost impossible to gauge how well you are doing if you are trying to work on habitually bad posture like myself. If you have ever attempted to change a habit, especially one that involves muscular consciousness and physical effort, you know that success cannot possibly be measured in hours for quite some period of time after beginning. I see this as a fairly significant barrier to this tool, actually. I have been in communication with them about this last bit, actually, because I think this issue is likely solved very easily and would benefit many of their users. We’ll see if they take my recommendation.

### Pie in the Sky Solutions

I am an extreme proponent of ubiquitous tech. The devices that already exist in our lives daily contain more than enough sensors, trackers,  and opportunities to address many of our tracking and monitoring needs. I approach most of my projects from this perspective, so I tend to remain within the limits of these devices when inventing solutions. Breaking down these limits, I would honestly like to see the concept of posture correction approached from a muscular tension, breath reduction, and/or a circulation variation perspective. Tracking these types of issues will do more than track posture, but also lead to opportunities for pain management and awareness/mindfulness of a large variety of other “silent killers” for many people. Imagine being made aware that your neck muscles were becoming tighter than normal and having the opportunity to correct before the tension headache sets in. Or being knowledgeable that the circulation in your legs is significantly decreased for periods of time through the day before you start to notice the varicose veins or worse, develop circulatory issues in your feet and toes.  If it were possible to design some sort of wearable, which could potentially become ubiquitous, say a thread, or some such, which was capable of achieving this sort of unnoticable, passive tracking, I believe it could help technological innovators begin to help solve a huge variety of health problems.
